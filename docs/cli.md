# CLI Commands

## ls Command
The `ls` command is used to list the contents of a directory. By running `ls`, you can see all files and subdirectories within the current directory. You can also use options like `ls -l` for a detailed list or `ls -a` to show hidden files.

## cat Command
The `cat` command, short for "concatenate," is used to display the contents of a file directly in the terminal. Itâ€™s often used to view small files, like configuration files or logs. For example, `cat filename.txt` will display the content of `filename.txt`.
